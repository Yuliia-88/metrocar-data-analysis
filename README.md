# 🚗 Metrocar Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes user behavior on the Metrocar platform to uncover patterns and improve user experience. It focuses on:
- Conversion funnel analysis  
- User interaction tracking  
- Age-based segmentation

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- PostgreSQL database - the primary source containing raw user and trip data, accessed via structured SQL queries
- Exported query results (CSV format) - selected datasets were exported as CSV files for further analysis in Excel and Power BI
- data/ folder - contains all exported CSV files used in this project, including user profiles, trip logs, event data, and calculated metrics such as waiting times

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- **SQL** - for querying and preprocessing the data
- **Google Sheets** - for initial analysis, pivot tables, and building PDF and CDF functions of waiting time
- **Power BI** - for interactive dashboards and visual data storytelling

## 📈 Visualizations  
Power BI Dashboards include:
- User and trip funnels - visualizing drop-off points across the registration and ride completion process
- User distribution by platform type - comparing engagement across mobile and web platforms
- Hourly breakdown of completed and cancelled rides - identifying peak times and cancellation patterns
