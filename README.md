# 🚗 Metrocar Funnel Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes user behavior on the Metrocar platform to uncover patterns and improve user experience. It focuses on:
- Conversion funnel analysis  
- User interaction tracking  
- Age-based segmentation

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- PostgreSQL database - the primary source containing raw user and trip data, accessed via structured SQL queries.
- Exported query results (CSV format) - selected datasets were exported as CSV files for further analysis in Excel and Power BI.

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- **SQL** - for querying and preprocessing the data
- **Google Sheets** - for initial analysis, pivot tables, and building PDF and CDF functions of waiting time
- **Power BI** - for interactive dashboards and visual data storytelling

## 📈 Visualizations  
Power BI Dashboards Include:
- User and trip funnels - visualizing drop-off points across the registration and ride completion process
- User distribution by platform type – comparing engagement across mobile and web platforms
- Hourly breakdown of completed and cancelled rides – identifying peak times and cancellation patterns
